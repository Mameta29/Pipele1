<hr />

A decentralized blogging app that facilitates writers to write user centric blog posts and to create token gated access to their content.

This project was submitted at [Encode x Polygon Hackathon 2022](https://www.encode.club/polygon-hackathon)

0xWriter main [contract](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xeEDc52b142FED56c675D7157f6C7F4f91aad33b0#code) is deployed and verified on polygon mumbai testnet.

## Features

- Write blog posts that are owned only by you.
- Create, read, update and delete posts.
- Deploy an ERC20 contract to create token gated access to your blog.
- All posts are encrypted.
- Set access control condition - minimum no. of your ERC20 tokens a reader must own to decrypt your content. Setting more conditions will be supported in the future.
- Writer - can mint their ERC20 tokens, transfer them, set new token price and withdraw their contract balance.
- Reader - can mint new writer's tokens and transfer them.
- Set or update your decentralized identity's basic profile - name, description and emoji.
